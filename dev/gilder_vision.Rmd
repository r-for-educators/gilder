```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r hist}
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins %>%
  gglot(aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


```{r}
gild("hist") %>%
  gild_filter(Species) %>%
  gild_aes("x", vars(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm))


### this would make a shiny app where:
## you chose from the possible Species and see the filtered data in the plot
## you choose between bill_length and bill_depth for the x-axis
```
